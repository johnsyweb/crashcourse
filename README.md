# Crashcourse

How accessible is this 5km course? Will participants and the public be able to enjoy the space together? Let's find out!

## What

1. Upload a course GPS data file (supported formats: `.gpx`, `.kml`).
2. See the course overlaid on OpenStreetMap.
3. Given a default path width, adjust it and specify narrower and wider sections.
4. Run simulations of walkers, joggers, and runners of varying paces and numbers following this course and highlight any areas of congestion. Add in some public path users with prams and bikes for good measure.
5. Tweak your course for accessibility, following the visualisations.

## Developing

   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the provided local development URL.

## Components and Responsibilities

### CourseSimulationApp

The main coordinator for the application flow. It handles the switching between the course data import and simulation stages, maintaining the state of the GPS course points.

### CourseDataImporter

Handles the importing and processing of GPS course data. It manages the file selection interface and handles the parsing of GPS files through the GPXFile component.

### CourseSimulation

Manages the visualization and interactive simulation of the course. It coordinates between the Map, Course, and Simulator components to provide a coherent simulation experience.

### FileUploadSection

A reusable component for the file upload interface, allowing users to select GPS files.

### GPXFile

A specialized component that handles parsing and processing of GPX files. Features include:

- Parsing XML data from GPX files
- Extracting track points with coordinates
- Error handling for malformed or incomplete GPS data
- Providing structured data (start/endpoints, track points) to parent components

### Course

A model representing an event course, defined by a series of geographical points. Features include:

- Calculating the total course length using the Haversine formula
- Providing access to start and finish points
- Finding coordinates at any specific distance along the course
- Determining the distance of a given position relative to the course

### CourseDisplay

A visualization component for rendering a course on a map. Features include:

- Rendering the course path as a polyline
- Displaying start and finish markers
- Optional kilometer markers along the course
- Customizable line styling

### Map

A reusable component that renders a Leaflet map with the ability to:

- Display geographical data using OpenStreetMap tiles
- Automatically fit map bounds to show all GPS points
- Accept children components like course paths and participant markers
- Customize initial center position and zoom level

### Simulator

Controls the simulation of participants' movement along a course. Features include:

- Start/stop/reset controls for the simulation
- Dynamic updating of participant positions based on elapsed time
- Real-time feedback on course length and participant count
- Integration with ElapsedTime for timing control

### ElapsedTime

A reusable timer component that displays and controls elapsed time. Features include:

- Start/stop/reset functionality with both button and keyboard controls (P, S, R keys)
- Visual display of elapsed time in minutes and seconds
- Callback support to notify parent components of time changes

### Participant

A model representing a participant in the simulation. Features include:

- Tracking position along a course based on elapsed time and pace
- Calculating cumulative distance traveled
- Supporting different paces (specified as minutes:seconds per kilometer)
- Reset capability to return to starting position
- Built to work directly with the Course class for efficient distance calculations and position determination

### FitBounds

A utility component that automatically adjusts the map view to fit all GPS points within the visible area.
